				<h3><font color="#5555aa">Welcome to this Experiment on "VISUAL PERFORMANCE IN MULTIDIMENSIONAL DATA CHARACTERISATION"</font></h3>
  				<p>You are invited to take  part in a research study to evaluate visual performance in data visualization using different coordinate systems: Cartesian coordinates and Parallel coordinates. This is a study being conducted by Dr. Ulrich Engelke (Research Scientist), Dr. Julian Heinrich (Postdoctoral Fellow), and Dr. Jenny Vuong (Postdoctoral Fellow), CSIRO, Australia. </p> 
				
				<p>On this screen, we will provide you with information about the experiment, ask you for your consent should you wish to continue with the experiment, and guide you through a qualification session that you need to pass in order to proceed with the experiment.</p>

  				<h3>Information About the Experiment</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><b>What is the purpose of this study?</b><br />
					Coordinate systems typically represent data points with regard to a set of axes. We aim to identify how well different coordinate systems allow viewers to effectively identify relative distances between such data points. We are particularly interested in the comparison between Cartesian coordinate systems and Parallel coordinate systems. We consider two, three, and four dimensions for each of these coordinate systems.</li>
					<li><b>What does this study involve?</b><br />
					This study requires you to view 66 coordinate system visualisations. In each coordinate system, you will see three points labelled as A, B, and C. You are asked to judge which of the points B or C is closer to point A. Prior to the actual experiment, we will have a qualification session in which we explain in more detail the task that needs to be performed. <b>The qualification session takes approximately 10 min</b>. You will be allowed to partake in the actual experiment if you pass the qualification session. <b>The whole experiment is estimated to take approximately 30 min.</b></li>
					<li><b>Are there any possible benefits from participation in this study?</b><br />
					<b>You will be paid 4.00 USD</b> for this HIT. The experiment provides important information about the effectiveness of multidimensional visualisation techniques to convey data to a user. Any person observing and working with similar data may therefore benefit from more effective and meaningful visualisation. </li>
					<li><b>Are there any possible risks from participating in this study?</b><br />
					There are no risks associated with this study. You are free to take as much time as needed and you can quit the experiment at any point without having to provide any particular reason. </li>
					<li><b>How will the data collected in this study be used?</b><br />
					The information that you provide for this research will be treated confidentially and will be used for the following purposes: CSIRO internal storage, statistical analysis and meta analysis with other experiments, research publications in conferences and journals. You will not be identified in any publications resulting from the study except where you have given written permission for this to occur. You may ask for part or all of the information provided to be removed from the study without penalty or explanation.</li>
					<li><b>What if I have questions about this research?</b><br />
					If you would like to discuss any aspect of this study please contact Dr. Ulrich Engelke (ulrich.engelke@csiro.au, +61 3 6237 5650) or Dr. Julian Heinrich (julian.heinrich@csiro.au, +61 2 9325 3112). This study has been approved by the CSIRO Human Research Ethics Board. If you have concerns or complaints about the conduct of this study you should contact the CSIRO Human Research Ethics Board +61 7 3833 5693 or csshrec@csiro.au.</li>

				<h3>Qualification Session</h3>
				<p>Before you can commence with the actual experiment you will have to successfully respond to six qualification stimuli. But first, we will guide you through some examples to make sure you fully understand your task.</p>
				
				<h4>Visualising Multidimensional Data</h4>

				As mentioned above, in this study we consider two types of coordinate systems: <b>Cartesian Coordinates</b> and <b>Parallel Coordinates</b>. With both coordinate systems, data points can be visualised using their coordinate-values. The main relevant differences between the two coordinate systems are: 
				<ul>
					<li>in Cartesian coordinate systems axes are drawn perpendicular (90 degree angle) to each other, whereas in Parallel coordinate systems axes are drawn in parallel to each other, and</li>
					<li>in Cartesian coordinate systems each datum is represented as a point, whereas in Parallel coordinate systems each datum is represented as a line.</li>
				</ul>
				

				For example, consider a datum with two coordinates D = (3, 7). In <b>Cartesian coordinates</b>, we can represent this datum by drawing a <i>point</i> at X1 = 3 and X2 = 7:

				<center><img src="https://parallelcoordinates.de/mturk/0.1_Cartesian.png" alt="Example Cartesian" width="800" /></center>

				Now consider a datum with three coordinates D = (3, 7, 1). To represent this in Cartesian coordinates, we have to use two coordinate systems: one for X1 = 3 and X2 = 7, and another one for X2 = 7 and X3 = 1:

				<center><img src="https://parallelcoordinates.de/mturk/0.2_Cartesian.png" alt="Example Cartesian" width="800" /></center>				
				Similarly, we need three Cartesian coordinate systems for data with four coordinates.

				To represent the same data in <b>parallel coordinates</b>, we can simply add one axis per dimension to the coordinate system and visualise D = (3, 7, 1) with a <i>line</i> that crosses all axes at the respective coordinates at X1 = 3, X2 = 7, and X3 = 1:

				<center><img src="https://parallelcoordinates.de/mturk/0.2_Parallel.png" alt="Example Parallel" width="800" /></center>

				<h4>Estimating Relative Distances</h4>

				Now that we know how to visualise a single, multidimensional datum in both coordinate systems, we can look at the resulting plots and estimate the <i>relative distance</i> of data points in all dimensions. For example, consider the following <b>2-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system</b> presenting three data points A, B, and C:
				<center>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td><img src="https://parallelcoordinates.de/mturk/0_Cartesian.png" alt="2dC" width="800" /></td>
							<td><img src="https://parallelcoordinates.de/mturk/legend_Cartesian.png" alt="2dC" height="100" /></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</center>
				The task question is as follows: <b>Please choose the point B or C that is closer in distance to point A.</b> In this example, we deliberately chose a very clear example: point B is closer to A than to C.
				
				The same points in parallel coordinates:
				<center>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td><img src="https://parallelcoordinates.de/mturk/0_Parallel.png" alt="2dC" width="800" /></td>
							<td ><img src="https://parallelcoordinates.de/mturk/legend_Parallel.png" alt="2dC" height="100" /></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</center>
				
				The line B is closer to the reference line A on both axes X1 and X2 than C. Again, the correct answer is: B is closer to A.

				Similarly, we can estimate the relative distance of A, B, and C in multiple dimensions:
				
				<center>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td><img src="https://parallelcoordinates.de/mturk/0.001_Cartesian.png" alt="2dC" width="800" /></td>
							<td ><img src="https://parallelcoordinates.de/mturk/legend_Cartesian.png" alt="2dC" height="100" /></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</center>	

				Here, point C is closer to A than B. The same points in parallel coordinates:

				<center>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td><img src="https://parallelcoordinates.de/mturk/0.001_Parallel.png" alt="2dC" width="800" /></td>
							<td ><img src="https://parallelcoordinates.de/mturk/legend_Parallel.png" alt="2dC" height="100" /></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</center>	
				
				<hr /><br /><br />
				<h3>EXAMPLE TASK QUESTIONS</h3>
				<p>In this section, we have chosen 6 preliminary task question to determine that you have understood the task. Please answer the following correctly in order to proceed to the main research study:</p>
				
				<h4> Task 1 </h4>
				<p>Please consider the following <b>2-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system</b> presenting three data points A, B, and C. Please choose the point B or C that is closer in distance to point A.</p>
