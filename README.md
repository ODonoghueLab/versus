#Description
Versus is a web-based application that allows users ('requesters') to create multiple experiments based on a full 2AFC methodology (two alternative forced-choice). Participants ('workers') are presented two images side-by-side, and - without imposing a time constraint - they are now asked to choose one of the two images, see Heinrich et al. (2015, 2016).

#Development Workflow

npm install
npm start
```
